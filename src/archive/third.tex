\section{Protocols and Performance}
The \emph{ASUS P5QPL-AM} motherboard features a variety of I/O ports and interfaces that accommodate different communication protocols. These include high-speed Gigabit Ethernet for network connectivity, medium-speed SATA ports for storage devices, USB 2.0 ports for versatile peripheral connection, and the low-speed legacy PS/2 ports for keyboard and mouse, PCI slots for expansion, VGA port for display, and PCIe slots for various expansion cards. Each protocol caters to specific communication needs, contributing to the motherboard's overall functionality and compatibility. It shoul

\section{Cooling Systems}

The \emph{ASUS P5QPL-AM} motherboard has an active cooling system. This means that it has fans or other active cooling devices to cool the motherboard components. The fan is located on the heatsink above the CPU. The fans help to circulate air around the motherboard, which helps to keep the components cool.

The motherboard has a large aluminum heatsink that covers the CPU socket. This heatsink is connected to the motherboard by some removable plastic screws. The metalblock in heatsink helps to transfer heat away from the CPU and to the heatsink fins, where it can be dissipated into the air using fan. The motherboard also has a small heatsink that covers the Northbridge and the Southbridge chipsets. These heatsinks are not as large as the CPU heatsink, but it is still effective at dissipating heat. It should be noted that there were remains of thermal paste on the chipsets and processor when the heatsinks were removed, signifying the importance of thermal compounds in providing a good thermal flow between the heatsink and the chips.

\section{Jumpers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Clear RTC RAM (4 in fig \ref{fig:using:mbdissected})} \\ 
        The CMOS RTC RAM data can be cleared by shorting the pins of the Clear RTC RAM jumper. This will erase the CMOS memory, which includes the date, time, and system setup parameters. The CMOS memory is powered by the onboard button cell battery, and it stores system setup information such as system passwords.
    \item \textbf {Keyboard power (3-pin KBPWR) (1 in fig \ref{fig:using:mbdissected})} \\
        The keyboard wake-up feature allows you to wake up the computer by pressing a key on the keyboard. To enable this feature, you need to set the jumper to pins 2â€“3 (+5VSB). This feature requires an ATX power supply that can supply at least 1A on the +5VSB lead, and a corresponding setting in the BIOS.
    \item \textbf{USB device wake-up (2 in fig \ref{fig:using:mbdissected})} \\
        The USB device wake-up feature allows you to wake up the computer from sleep mode using the connected USB devices. To enable this feature, you need to set the jumper to +5V for S1 sleep mode and +5VSB for S3 and S4 sleep modes.
